TALM exhibits strong performance on both a knowledge-heavy QA\\ntask and a reasoning oriented math task with simple tools. At a given model\\nscale, TALM significantly outperforms non-augmented LMs. We further demonstrate\\nthat TALM successfully performs out-of-distribution inferences on both QA and\\nmath tasks, where non-augmented LMs fail. Our results suggest that Tool\\nAugmented Language Models are a promising direction to enrich LMs\\'\\ncapabilities, with less dependence on scale.'"
